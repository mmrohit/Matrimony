This site is a project made by M.M.Rohit as part of his training program for CSC. 
<br>
<hr class=about>
Initially started off as a divorce settlement site, my trainee just couldn't see the bright side of that idea and eventually this ended up being a matrimonial site.
<br><hr class=about>
This site exists only within the network of abridge solutions (at least when I made it and I believe it is only going to stay there only). Only few people from my batch would be seeing it,
Hence I can't put up any success stories and images of people who have had a successful affiliation with this site <img src="sad.jpg" height=20 width=20/>
<br><hr class=about>
Anyway it was a good thing that I didn't go ahead with the divorce site because we can't make money out of it. People getting married with in CSC can not put a case on CSC (as per my CST trainer Boidehi). Hence it is a waste of time.
<br><hr class=about>
Well that's as honest as I can be.. Enjoy the site.  If someone actually ends up getting married, I will pay everything for the marriage. <img src="tounge.png" height=20 width=20><br>
